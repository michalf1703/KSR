<DATELINE></DATELINE><BODY>Sandoz AG it planned a joint venture
                           to produce herbicides in the Soviet Union.
                               The company said it had signed a letter of intent with the
                           Soviet Ministry of Fertiliser Production to form the first
                           foreign joint venture the ministry had undertaken since the
                           Soviet Union allowed Western firms to enter into joint ventures
                           two months ago.
                               The ministry and Sandoz will each have a 50 pct stake, but
                           a company spokeswoman was unable to give details of the size of
                           investment or planned output.</BODY></TEXT>
